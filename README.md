# Photometry
Previous Photometry lab projects completed for UCD Space science Undergraduate.
Some of the data for these projects is currently absent so if you wanted to recreate the attached images you'll need to provide your own data, which can be downloaded here https://ps1images.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/ps1cutouts.

Files also include the PSF photometry and Date Compressed Fourier Transform Analysis I used in my final year project in the study of recurrent novae
The PSF photometry played a critical role in reconstructing saturated images due to long exposures of images taken by Hubble and Pan-STARRS. This exercise aswell as the date compressed Fourier Transform provided key tools that helped deduce the recurrent nature of these stars and determine patterns.
